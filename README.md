# EIGRP Network Configuration - Cisco Packet Tracer 

## Overview 
This project demonstrates an EIGRP-based network topology using Cisco Packet
Tracer. The configuration enables dynamic routing between mutiple networks.

## Features 
- EIGRP routing implementation 
- Multiple routers with subnetted networks 
- Route summarization and neighbor adjacency 

## Files Included 
- **EIGRP.pkt** - The main Packet TRacer file 
- **Router_1.txt** - Exported configuraion from all routers 
- **Router_2.txt** - Exported configuraion from all routers
- **Router_3.txt** - Exported configuraion from all routers
- **Router_4.txt** - Exported configuraion from all routers
- **Router_5.txt** - Exported configuraion from all routers
- **Router_6.txt** - Exported configuraion from all routers
## How to use 
1. Open the `.pkt` file in Cisco Packet Tracer 
2. Review the router configurations
3. Simulate and analyze the EIGRP routing behavior
